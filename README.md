##🧠 Architecture Overview

Core Module: global services, interceptors, and guards

Shared Module: reusable UI components, directives, and pipes

Feature Modules: product listing, authentication, cart, checkout, profile, etc.

Lazy Loading: for feature modules to optimize bundle size

Route Guards: ensure users can’t access pages without authentication

Resolver Guards: preload critical data before rendering pages

State Management: powered by RxJS with BehaviorSubjects and Observables
---


##🔐 Authentication Workflow

1.User registers via API → receives JWT token

2.Token stored securely in cookies

3.Auth Guard checks token validity before activating routes

4.Interceptor attaches token to every API call

5.Logout clears cookies and redirects to login
